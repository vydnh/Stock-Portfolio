# Stock-Portfolio-Correlation-matrix
It is well known that a well-diversified portfolio benefits from holding assets with low correlation across different groups, while assets within each group should ideally have high correlation.

This project focuses on constructing a portfolio based solely on the correlation matrix and analyzing its performance. This serves as a test with many limitations, all of which have been addressed throughout the project.
